Project Summary: clickKloudy
This project aims to develop a web-based application that enables users to manage up to 1,000 social media accounts across 35 platforms, post content efficiently, and track analytics. The application is designed to save time, improve workflow, and provide insights into content performance.

Core Features
Multi-Platform Posting:

Users can upload videos or images and select accounts and platforms for automated posting.
Batch posting across multiple accounts with a single action.
Account Management:

Support for managing up to 1,000 social media accounts.
Secure storage of account credentials and API tokens.
Analytics Dashboard:

Collect and display data on reach, views, and engagement for posts.
Visualized through charts and tables for easy interpretation.
Task Scheduling:

Automate content posting with scheduled tasks.
Retry mechanisms for failed posts due to API rate limits or connectivity issues.
Secure Authentication:

OAuth 2.0 integration for connecting social media accounts.
User authentication and role-based access control for secure access.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js for a fast, interactive user interface.
Hosted on Azure Static Web Apps for scalability and simplicity.
Charts rendered using Chart.js for analytics visualization.
Backend:

Python with FastAPI for a lightweight, high-performance API layer.
Deployed on Azure App Service to handle user requests and integrations.
Databases:

Azure Database for PostgreSQL for structured data like user profiles, posts, and accounts.
Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API) for unstructured data like logs and metadata.
Task Management:

Celery for scheduling and executing tasks like posting content.
Azure Queue Storage to manage task queues and ensure reliability.
Media Storage:

Azure Blob Storage for scalable and secure storage of videos and images.
Analytics:

Azure Data Factory to process and clean analytics data from social media APIs.
Azure Data Explorer to store and query analytics data quickly.
Security:

Azure AD B2C for user authentication and OAuth token management.
Azure Key Vault for secure management of API keys and sensitive information.
Monitoring:

Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track performance and handle errors.
How It Works
User Workflow:

Users log in securely.
They upload content, select accounts, and schedule posts.
The app automates posting to the selected accounts and platforms.
Task Processing:

Posting tasks are added to a queue managed by Azure Queue Storage.
Workers (Celery) process these tasks and interact with social media APIs.
Analytics Collection:

Social media platforms provide data on reach and engagement through their APIs.
The app fetches this data, processes it, and displays it in the dashboard.
Why This Stack?
Scalability: Azure services like Blob Storage, Queue Storage, and App Service scale automatically with demand.
Reliability: Built-in redundancy in Azure ensures high uptime.
Efficiency: FastAPI and React.js provide a fast and user-friendly experience.
Security: OAuth 2.0 and Azure Key Vault protect user data and credentials.
Development Steps
Frontend:

Build the user interface for account management, posting, and analytics.
Integrate React.js with the backend via APIs.
Backend:

Develop APIs for user management, task scheduling, and analytics.
Integrate with social media APIs for posting and fetching data.
Database:

Set up PostgreSQL for structured data.
Use Cosmos DB for unstructured data storage.
Infrastructure:

Deploy components on Azure services.
Configure monitoring and CI/CD pipelines for smooth updates.
Benefits of the Application
Reduces time spent switching between accounts and platforms.
Provides a centralized view of all accounts and their analytics.
Offers scalability to handle a large number of accounts and platforms.
Enhances security with robust authentication and API management.
